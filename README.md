# python-challenge

PyBank: 


For this challenge, I was taked with opening a CSV file, getting the data and analyising it within python. The tasks were to determine the total amount of revenue, how many months the data set span across. The Month over month (or MOM) change from each month's profit/ loss. Once you found this data, I found was able to find the average profit loss (total MOM change - (months-1)).  Since I already had this data, I was able to find which month had the greatest increase in profits and which had the greatest decrease in profits (greatest loss). I was able to get the following results: 
 Financial Analysis
----------------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($ 1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profites Feb-14 ($ -1825558)


PyPoll:

For this challenge, I was given a dataset containing the raw election results for 3 candidates. I was required to figure out how many votes each candidate recieved and the percent of total votes that was. Since I had this information, I was also required to produce a code that will find the winner and display it. I got the following results:

Election Results
----------------------------------
 Total Votes: 369711
----------------------------------

Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)

Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)

Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
